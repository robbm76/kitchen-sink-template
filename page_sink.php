<h2>Header Two: Nuts &amp; Bolts</h2>
Here is a paragraph that lays out all of the <strong>belowÂ items</strong> in natural conversation. It's sometimes <em>easier to style</em> when you see it as it will appear on the page. <em><strong>For this reason</strong></em>, I have gone through <a href="#">the trouble</a> to create this paragraph. It should have everything you need to get an idea of what you're working with.
<ul>
	<li><strong>This is some bold text</strong></li>
	<li><em>This is some italicized text</em></li>
	<li>This is some underlined text</li>
	<li><del>Strikethrough that text yo!</del></li>
	<li><a href="#">This is a link.</a></li>
	<li><em><strong>This is some text with the works--hold the strikethrough.</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<h3>Header 3: Let's Talk About Lists</h3>

</ul>
An ordered List! Oh yeah
